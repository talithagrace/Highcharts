<p>Examples of data visualisations using Highcharts</p>
<p>This repository contains an example of a chart which uses data located in CSV files. Using Highcharts click point event function,
users can drill down on points on the chart to reveal charts which also use CSV source data.</p>
<p>These charts work fine in Microsoft Edge, however Chrome does not allow the browser to access local files by default. Please read
here for further information and a way to temporarily allow this in Chrome:</p>
